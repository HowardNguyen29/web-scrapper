Abby P.,5,Amazing service. Despite being busy they have a great system for getting you seated quickly. Such a cool vibe in there. Some of the best Thai food I've had in a while. Cant wait to come back when I am in Toronto.
Sana T.,5,"Great food, great service! We went on a Tuesday night and there was about a 50 min wait. There's regular table and communal table which we got sat at. It's perfectly fine! The food was absolutely delicious! The panang curry and pad kra prow were my favorites! The thai spicy level was so spicy!!! Would recommend farang spicy or medium if possible. The coconut sorbet was absolutely delicious!!! Great way to end the night"
Sohail M.,4,"We got here late at 9:30pm on a Saturday night.  A good size restaurant with plenty of seating and a variety of decor, really liked that.  About 70% full, got seated immediately.  A mostly young crowd at that hour.  We chose only main dishes as the kitchen was closing in less than a half hour.  A Basil Thai stir fry and a Penang curry, neither of which are specific to northern Thailand.  The Penang curry with beef was about average, not enough zing to the sauce, and it was not served hot enough, I let that pass due to the lateness of the hour. The stir fry presented nicely, very colourful, once again though served only lukewarm.  Wait staff were extremely friendly and professional.  I wish we had ordered something more specific to the North of Thailand like the khao suey and so can only give an average rating to the food due to the taste of the dishes we did order, but give an excellent rating to the ambiance, service and value.  We will return for another taste."
Aram K.,5,"This seemed to be the most frequently and highly reviewed restaurant in all of Toronto, on both YelpAnd Google, so I had to give it a try. When you think of a place like Toronto, your first instinct is that Canadian food would be the most popular. But Canada is a melting pot of cultures, and there's a strong Asian influence here. We figured all the rave reviews about this place was reason enough to see what all the hype was about. We got here on a Tuesday evening and it was so packed that we waited for 35 minutes!! I couldn't believe how busy it was on a Tuesday. That was my initial indication that I was about to have some good food. The ambiance was casual but cool at the same time. Have you ever been to one of those famous people that post famous people's pictures who have visited their restaurant on the wall before? It was very much like that. While we were waiting for a table we decided to have a drink at the bar. There were no bar stools which was great because we didn't have to fight anyone for the bartenders attention, so we stayed standing up ordering drinks and enjoying them. We had the Lowry and the Thai mojito, my fiancés favorite was the Lowry and mine was the Thai mojito. Both were Very smooth and easy to drink. Once we sat down, the service was incredibly fast which was surprising since it was so busy. We were attended to right away, they would come backTo check on us and if we needed anything, it wouldn't take long to get it. We noticed that the most popular item on Yelp was the pad Thai, so even though it's such a typical Thai food item, we had to try it. The pad Thai was really good, we got almost the spiciest level (faraang spicy) and added extra spice on the side but it wasn't as spicy as Thai food in LA where we're originally from usually is. The pad Thai was my fiancés favorite all time pad Thai, I'm a little bit more of a food snob, to me it was a solid 4.5 star out of 5, loved it but I feel like I've had slightly better, but it was definitely top 10 I've ever had everywhere I've traveled. We ordered the grabong (squash fritters), even though we read a review from someone saying that it didn't have flavor. Let me tell you, as long as you dip it in the dip they provide you, it is popping full of flavor. By itself without the dip, it's pretty plain. We loved it and dipped to our hearts content. I noticed the Khao Soi soup looking dish seemed like my kind of meal, so I couldn't pass up ordering it, and I'm glad I did. There was so much broth that after eating it with the noodles, I ordered white rice and added it into the soup and it's like I had 2 meals from the same dish. And in my opinion it was great with noodles but even better with the white rice!! The flavor was also finger licking good. I would love to come back and try more dishes here"
Emma B.,4,"Everyone said we had to eat here while in Toronto. We arrived ten minutes after opening on a Saturday afternoon. I'm not sure how large the restaurant has and how many rooms but it seemed already pretty full when we got there. We were sat straight away. Service was decent. You use the QR code for the menu. A lot of items aren't available til after 4pm - which is a shame. I had the Pad See Ew with shrimp which was delicious, the rice noodles were great, I like that they gave you the spice on the side so you could add your own heat level. My husband didn't order well and went with the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup, he was looking for something like Drunken Noodles which is what my dish was similar to, he wanted wide noodles and messed up! Lol. His dish was still good but not what he was looking for."
Jesus H.,5,"My girlfriend and I needed some Thai food in our life while we're visiting Toronto and Pai looked exactly what we were looking for. The place has really cute decor and the staff is extremely nice. They have a pretty extensive menu so there's a little bit of something for everyone. My gf and I started with the chicken wings and orders Pad Thai and Khao Soi. Both were incredible, the flavors were on point for all three items. We grabbed a few drinks and those were fantatsic as well! Prices were pretty good all around and won't break the bank. If my gf and I ever find ourselfs in Toronto we will definitely be back!"
Chithra V.,5,"Absolutely loved this place! There was a wait time for 25 minutes, but I was called within 5 minutes of joining the wait list. The waiter took the time to go over the entire menu and explained which ones I could go with according to my taste pallete. Got to try their lychee cocktail which is Tequila based and also ordered their Pad grow Pro vegan bacon which was out of the world. It's a must try!!  Ambience was good too with enough seating and waiting area"
Marisa C.,5,"What a great way to kick off our first meal in Toronto! Since it was the highest reviewed spot we figured it has to be good! We went for a late lunch, around 3:30-4ish. They told us it would be about a 20 minute wait but we only waited like 10 minutes.For food we ordered the Pai Thai with chicken and the Khao Soi Beef 22 CAD each. Omg you NEED to order the Khao Soi, I could literally just drink the sauce forever. The Pai Thai was good but I feel like I've had better, it wasn't bad just not the best I've ever had. Portions are pretty substantial, so you could probably share and get an appetizer.The decor inside is cool, with fun details. Service was good and staff was friendly. I definitely recommend visiting this place while in Toronto!!"
Erin L.,5,"So good, it kind of ruined Thai food (non-Pai) for me foreverWaited about a half hour on a Saturday afternoon. Seems a little silly to have a waiting space when it could just be more seats, but it works and you'll find people waiting. They offer a call back but I'm visiting from US so we opted to wait. We were just about to order our Thai teas from the bar when we were seated - wish there was more encouragement to take advantage of the bar while waiting, but I digressThe Khao Soi is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The presentation and the lightness of the curry go hand-in-hand to a really special experience. It's pretty big and can be shared. We also had some skewers that were so moist and tender. Yum yum!This was also just peak experience for us - the restaurant is so cute and so much to look at. The staff is extremely kind and friendly too, they even gave us some city recommendations. Yeah I can't eat from any other Thai restaurant again. Thanks a lot you guys (sarcasm here)"
Jamie S.,5,"You can't tell from the outside but this place is MASSIVE .. there was a long long but for good reason. The line goes fast and have a coconut water and Thai ice tea was great. Some of the best Thai food of my life. We live in Pittsburgh PA, and Toronto is a five hour drive cool city and this place will make it work the drive."
